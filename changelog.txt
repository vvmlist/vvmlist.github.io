		vvm count: 145
		
		todo
			-tag revamp (multi-value tags should be seperated)
			-filter with difficulty and platform (gonna ask how to do it on stackoverflow)
			-new favicon (using win95 globe .ico right now)
			-vm name css corrections would be good (vms with long name cause overflow)
			-paths (beginner, oscp, but what for middle-tier?)
